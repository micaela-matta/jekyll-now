## pycoupling: a Python code to calculate electronic couplings

Pycoupling calculates electronic coupling between dimers using the projection method[ref]. It can read outputs from ORCA, Gaussian0X, and many others. It is possible to calculate couplings at both DFT and semi-empirical (ie ZINDO) levels.

This code uses [cclib](cclib_link) and is freely available on [github](myrepo).
