### Teaching Interests
 

I am confident teaching all flavors of physical chemistry and general chemistry courses as well as organic electronics, polymer/materials chemistry at both graduate and undergraduate level. I would love to develop and teach a course focused on the Python programming language and its applications in computational chemistry; this could be either tailored towards graduate students or towards Master/Bachelor students as an introductory programming course with general scope. I also plan to cover version control (git) and data visualization. 


### Teaching experience

Over my PhD and postdoctoral career, I have actively sought multiple occasions to teach and mentor students for laboratory classes and projects. I have acquired experience in teaching a wide range of physical chemistry laboratory classes, including kinetics and thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, scientific programming in Italian, English and French. At Northwestern University I gave guest General Chemistry lectures to ~200 first year students; I also co-organized and taught a 2-day workshop on data analysis of molecular simulations based around the python package MDAnalysis that saw participants from across the US. The workshop material is freely available [here](https://www.mdanalysis.org/WorkshopHackathon2018/).
