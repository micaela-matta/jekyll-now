The belief that everyone belongs in STEM is a core part of my identity as a scientist. 

I have given science talks in schools and pubs, I serve in the departmental Diversity, Equity and Inclusion group and I coordinate the Liverpool chapter of [500WomenScientists](www.500womenscientists.org), a global association for women in science. 

As a member of the [MDAnalysis](www.mdanalysis.org) software development community, I have co-organised a workshop on data analysis of molecular simulations with scholarships for students belonging to underrepresented minorities. 

### Soapbox Science Liverpool 2021

I am co-organizing the first Liverpool [Soapbox Science](www.soapboxscience.org), a free and interactive event where women in STEM communicate their work.
