## Future Events

I am among the awardees of a [NumFOCUS Grant](https://numfocus.org/blog/summer-2018-open-source-development-grants) for community education and engagement.

We are organizing a workshop on [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org), a free and open source Python package that allows to analyze trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations in the most common formats, aimed at increasing the user base of MDAnalysis. We are providing financial support for students belonging from underrepresented groups interested in attending the event. The [workshop](https://www.workshop.mdanalysis.org) will be held on Nov 12-13, 2018 at Northwestern University in Evanston.



## Past Events

I presented at the August event of [Wonder and Skepticism](http://www.wonderandskepticism.com/about) at the Empty Bottle on on Aug 29th, a monthly series where scientists talk about their work with patrons over beer(s).

I volunteered for [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org) in Chicago (their first ever event in the US!) and it was awesome. I look forward to participating next year.
