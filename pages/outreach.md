I am involved in kickstarting the local chapter of [500WomenScientists](https://500womenscientists.org), an international community of women committing towards inclusivity in science. 

I am participating in [SkypeaScientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com) which pairs scientists with classrooms around the world. 

## Past Events

I am among the awardees of a [NumFOCUS Grant](https://numfocus.org/blog/summer-2018-open-source-development-grants) for community education and engagement.

We co-organized a [workshop](https://www.mdanalysis.org/WorkshopHackathon2018/) on [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org), at Northwestern University. MDAnalysis is a free and open source Python package that allows to analyze trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations in the most common formats. We provided financial support for students belonging from underrepresented groups interested in attending the event.


I presented at [Wonder and Skepticism](http://www.wonderandskepticism.com/about), a monthly series held at a music venue in Chicago where scientists talk about their work with patrons over beer(s).

I volunteered for [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org) in Chicago (their first ever event in the US!) and it was awesome. I look forward to participating next year.
