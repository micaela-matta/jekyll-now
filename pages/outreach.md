The belief that everyone belongs in STEM is a core part of my identity as a scientist. I have given science talks in schools and pubs, I serve in the departmental Diversity, Equity and Inclusion group and I coordinate the Liverpool chapter of [500WomenScientists](www.500womenscientists.org), a global association for women in science. As a member of the [MDAnalysis](www.mdanalysis.org) software development community, I have forganised a workshop on data analysis of molecular simulations with scholarships for students belonging to underrepresented minorities. 


#### recent updates:

- I will be speaking at Liverpool Pint of Science 2020 which has been postponed to May 2021.
