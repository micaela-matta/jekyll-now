## Events

I will be presenting at the August event of [Wonders and Skepticism](http://www.wonderandskepticism.com/about) at the Empty Bottle, a monthly series where scientists talk about their work with patrons over beer(s).



I also volunteered for [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org) in Chicago (their first ever in the US!) and it was awesome. I look forward to participating next year.
