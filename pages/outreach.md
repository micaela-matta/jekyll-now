## Future Events

I am among the awardees of a [NumFOCUS Grant](https://numfocus.org/blog/summer-2018-open-source-development-grants) for community education and engagement.

We are organizing a workshop on python for molecular dynamics simulations, aimed at increasing the user base of MDAnalysis. We are providing financial support for students coming from underrepresented groups interested in attending the event. The workshop will be held in fall 2018 at Northwestern University.

I will be presenting at the August event of [Wonder and Skepticism](http://www.wonderandskepticism.com/about) at the Empty Bottle, a monthly series where scientists talk about their work with patrons over beer(s).


## Past Events

I volunteered for [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org) in Chicago (their first ever event in the US!) and it was awesome. I look forward to participating next year.
