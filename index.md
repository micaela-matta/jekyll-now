I am a **Royal Society Newton International Fellow** at the University of Liverpool, hosted by prof. Alessandro Troisi.

## **Towards eumelanin-based bioelectronic devices: a multiscale description of ionic and electronic transport**

I am working on developing a computational model of eumelanin, the biopigment present in human hair, eyes and skin, as a potential semiconductor in bioelectronic devices (sensors, implants). My goal is to obtain an atomistic description of this biopolymer able to capture its structure-property relationship, and ultimately develop a charge transport model able to capture both electronic and ionic conduction.

**Buzzwords**: Organic (bio)electronics, eumelanin, OECTs, non-fullerene acceptors and polymer donors for OPV,
mechanical properties of molecular solids, molecular dynamics, (TD)-DFT, self-assembly, photophysics, charge/exciton transport.
