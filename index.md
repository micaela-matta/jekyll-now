I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Schatz group](http://sites.northwestern.edu/schatz/) at Northwestern University.

I study novel materials for organic electronics using a combination of molecular dynamics and electronic structure methods.


**Buzzwords**: Organic (bio)electronics, non-fullerene acceptors and polymer donors for OPV,
mechanical properties of molecular solids, molecular dynamics, (TD)-DFT, self-assembly, photophysics, charge/exciton transport.


## News

20 Aug 2018 - Our [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/15/1807535115) paper on non-fullerene electron acceptors is now out!

29 Aug 2018 - I will present my work at [Wonder and Skepticism](http://www.wonderandskepticism.com/about)

20 Nov 2018 - I'm going to the [MRS Fall Meeting in Boston](https://www.mrs.org/fall2018) and I will give a talk on my recent work on OPV.
