I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellow at the University of Liverpool, hosted in the group of Alessandro Troisi.

I am interested in how the macroscopic properties of organic semiconductors are determined at the nanoscale level. Throughout my work, I have sought to relate the insight from a wide range of theoretical methods into valuable models that directly translate to experimental observables. For my publications list, see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=o4zoWRQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

### MSCA-IF BIOMOSAIC *From biopigments to bioelectronics: modeling semiconducting eumelanin-based interfaces*

I am working on developing a computational model of eumelanin, the biopigment present in human hair, eyes and skin, as a potential semiconductor in bioelectronic devices. My goal is to unravel its structure-property relationship, and ultimately build a charge transport model able to capture both electronic and ionic conduction.
