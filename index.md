I am a postdoctoral research associate in the group of [Prof. George Schatz](http://sites.northwestern.edu/schatz/) at Northwestern University.

I study novel materials for organic electronics by means of dynamics simulations and electronic structure methods.


**Buzzwords**: Organic (bio)electronics, non-fullerene acceptors and polymer donors for OPV,
mechanical properties of molecular solids, molecular dynamics, (TD)-DFT, self-assembly, photophysics, charge/exciton transport.
