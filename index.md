I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Schatz group](http://sites.northwestern.edu/schatz/) at Northwestern University.

I study novel materials for organic electronics using a combination of molecular dynamics and electronic structure methods.

I'm going to the [MRS Fall Meeting in Boston](https://www.mrs.org/fall2018) and I will give a talk on my recent work on OPV.

Thanks to a [NumFOCUS Grant](https://numfocus.org/blog/summer-2018-open-source-development-grants) for community education and engagement, I am co-organizing the [2018 MDAnalysis Workshop and Hackathon](https://www.workshop.mdanalysis.org) here at Northwestern University!

**Buzzwords**: Organic (bio)electronics, non-fullerene acceptors and polymer donors for OPV,
mechanical properties of molecular solids, molecular dynamics, (TD)-DFT, self-assembly, photophysics, charge/exciton transport.
