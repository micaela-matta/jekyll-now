I am a **Marie Curie Fellow** at the University of Liverpool, hosted in the group of [Prof. Alessandro Troisi](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/alessandro-troisi/).

## **MSCA-IF H2020 BIOMOSAIC**
#### From biopigments to bioelectronics: modeling semiconducting eumelanin-based interfaces

I am working on developing a computational model of eumelanin, the biopigment present in human hair, eyes and skin, as a potential semiconductor in bioelectronic devices (sensors, implants). My goal is to obtain an atomistic description of this biopolymer able to capture its structure-property relationship, and ultimately develop a charge transport model able to capture both electronic and ionic conduction.

**Buzzwords**: Organic (bio)electronics, eumelanin, OECTs, non-fullerene acceptors and polymer donors for OPV,
mechanical properties of molecular solids, molecular dynamics, (TD)-DFT, self-assembly, photophysics, charge/exciton transport.
