I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Schatz group](http://sites.northwestern.edu/schatz/) at Northwestern University.

I study novel materials for organic electronics using a combination of molecular dynamics and electronic structure methods.


I have formally accepted a **Royal Society Newton International Fellowship** that will bring me to the University of Liverpool in March 2019.

I will work with prof. Alessandro Troisi on developing a multiscale description of eumelanin-based transistors for bioelectronics.


**Buzzwords**: Organic (bio)electronics, eumelanin, OECTs, non-fullerene acceptors and polymer donors for OPV,
mechanical properties of molecular solids, molecular dynamics, (TD)-DFT, self-assembly, photophysics, charge/exciton transport.
